[[Primalas.png|Full Art]]

A neutral passenger on [[The Kilfenora]] and someone who took great interest in both you and [[- Quinn -/Characters/PC/Brannon/Bismuth Shatterborne|Bismuth]].

Primalas mostly kept to himself on the ship, bar his time spent with you: wrapped head to foot in a hooded, heavy dull cloak. 

Primalas paid for passage to Seni to research its culture and visit the [[Imperial library of Heinabergsar]]. Primalas has said that he'll make his own way to [[Heinabergsar]] when the ship docks in [[Potton-Ton]].

During travel, Primalas paid particular attention to you - Often spending long periods of time with you, barraging you with questions about your time travelling through [[- Quinn -/Locations/Chimo-Nahagi/Chimo|Chimo]].
