A small village that you awoke a few miles away from in a crater 70ft across and 60ft deep.

After feeling a sudden compulsion to head south, you travelled across the countryside, eventually falling into a river - when you awoke, you found yourself washed up on the bank of the river. With the rain lashing down on you, you head towards the nearest source of light you can see - the walled town of Virmarr.

After walking into town, you walk down the main road of Virmarr until another strong sensation of compulsion makes you stop, turning to your right you see [[The Copper Cask]]
