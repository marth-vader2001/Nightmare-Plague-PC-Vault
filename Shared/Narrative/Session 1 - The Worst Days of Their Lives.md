## The Twinned Ship


## The Librarian's Accord
Cutting to [[The Copper Cask]] of [[Virmarr]], we are introduced to [[Duska Von Mori]], a librarian of [[Sunmaek]]. Accompanied by [[Chancellor Sturgis]] and his daughter [[Hinelle]], the trio are waiting upon the arrival of a contact from the city of [[Brokvar]] who is set to guide them the rest of the way to the city. The contact, [[Elaine]], is set to arrive in three days time.

...

As events reach a climax, a dazed and fatigued character stumbles into the bar 

## Rise From The Ashes
A week prior to the events that unfolded in the Copper Cask, [[Mazikeen (private)]] finds themselves awakening in a grand crater - around them lie shards of green crystalline matter. To their right, lies a burnt up husk that may have once resembled another person and to their left, partly clutched in their hand, a broken weapon.

...

Mazikeen is drawn to the sound of civilisation, somewhere south of where she currently is
