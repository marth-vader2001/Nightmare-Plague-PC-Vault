## The Emergence
Tom awakens in a bed, but not his own bed
House is empty, steps out and very clearly not where he's meant to be

Tom sees a wagon driver going past, offered transport to Town (Virmarr)

Tom enters Tavern, finds Bismuth, Jasper, Elaine and others in the common room.

Food comes out for Bimsuth and Jasper, its a pie
