Sansom lives in a cavern deep beneath [[- Brannon -/Locations/Chimo-Nahagi/Major Locations/Yamanohana|Yamanohana]] and spends most of his time carving grand structures into his halls.

Sansom's lineage grants you the feat: *Earthen Control*
>You reach out with your innate connection to the earth, allowing you to shape and manipulate the very ground beneath your feet. By touching a portion of dirt or stone within your reach, no larger than a 5-foot cube, you can mold it to your will. However, to maintain the desired form, you must maintain physical contact with the material throughout the spell's duration.
