Auroris is a Crystal Djinn

Djinn lineage of [[- Brannon -/Characters/NPC/Chimo-Nahagi/Shatterborne Family/Dolomite (Dola) Shimmerborne|Dolomite Shimmerborne]]; and consequently: [[- Brannon -/Characters/PC/Quinn/Jasper|Jasper]] and [[- Brannon -/Characters/PC/Brannon/Bismuth|Bismuth]].

Auroris is a solitary Djinn and as such you have never met her; however, your being of her lineage is highly likely due to the composition of your form: a synergy between earthen and crystalline structures.

Auroris' lineage grants you the feat: *Crystalline Defence*
>Calling upon your innate connection to the structures within the ground around you, you channel the essence of your Genasi heritage to draw forth crystals from your surroundings, shaping them into a formidable armour. As the minerals interweave and mold around your body, you feel an increased sense of protection enveloping you.
