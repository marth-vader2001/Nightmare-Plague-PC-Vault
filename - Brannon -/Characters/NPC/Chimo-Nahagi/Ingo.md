### Notes
Works as the barkeep and landlady of [[- Brannon -/Locations/Seni Isles/Brokvar/The Copper Cask|The Copper Cask]].


Ingo was one of the more charismatic crew members aboard [[- Quinn -/Additional Lore/Ships/The Kilfenora|The Kilfenora]]. In charge of the artillery, Ingo was the ships first line of defence against off-board trouble; and its gambling extraordinaire. 

Hailing from [[- Brannon -/Locations/Chimo-Nahagi/Chimo|Chimo]], Ingos participation in the trade of Chimo slaves to foreign powers was somewhat troubling and confusing to you.

Despite his mostly calm demeanour, Ingo seemed to take particular distaste to you - often shooting cold looks across the decks.
