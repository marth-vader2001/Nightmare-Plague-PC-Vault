### Notes
Ingo was one of the more charismatic crew members aboard [[- Quinn -/Additional Lore/Ships/The Kilfenora|The Kilfenora]]. In charge of the artillery, Ingo was the ships first line of defence against off-board trouble; and its gambling extraordinaire. 

Ingo was found dead in his cabin, his throat discoloured black like [[- Brannon -/Characters/NPC/Chimo-Nahagi/Merlin|Merlin]]'s

A neutral passenger on [[- Quinn -/Additional Lore/Ships/The Kilfenora]] and someone who took great interest in both you and [[- Quinn -/Characters/PC/Quinn/Jasper|Jasper]].

Primalas mostly kept to himself on the ship: wrapped head to foot in a hooded, heavy dull cloak. The only adornment he wore was a simple brooch pinning the cloak together: a golden eye, studded with a rich ruby in place of its iris. 

Fond of the game Liar's dice, Primalas' sole regular excursion would be to play with the ship's crew. [[- Brannon -/Characters/NPC/Chimo-Nahagi/Ingo|Ingo]] was the only one of which that ever gave him trouble: something about that Tabaxi's cool demeanour...

Primalas paid for passage to Seni to research its culture and visit the [[Imperial library of Heinabergsar]]. Primalas has said that he'll make his own way to [[- Brannon -/Locations/Seni Isles/Rheilliwch/Heinabergsar]] when the ship docks in [[Potton-Ton]].
