*Pictured: Kaede coming out of a slumber. Kaede has the ability to merge in with all things natural*

Mother of all life of Chimo-Nahagi, Kaede is one of the few flightless greater dragons but that lack of flight does not deter her from her ever on going work. It is said that Kaede is as long as the measurable life of all living things: which is to be said that no one has ever seen her tail.

You and [[- Brannon -/Characters/PC/Quinn/Jasper|Jasper]] were greeted by Kaede in [[- Brannon -/Locations/Chimo-Nahagi/The Forest of Mori|The Forest of Mori]]after encountering a [[- Brannon -/Bestiary/Beasts/Wilderbeast|Wilderbeast]] and mistakenly assuming it to be hostile toward you. 

Kaede was kind enough to bless both of you as a sign of good will and forgiveness for both the intrusion and the pain caused to her: which is itself a child of Kaede.

##### Bismuth's gift

Kaede granted a partial control over Bismuth's inherent ability to control his form: unlike Jasper's mastery of druidic animorphing, Bismuth is only capable of transforming partial parts of his body and only into the form of the Wilderbeast.

##### Jasper's gift

Kaede gifted Jasper a [[- Brannon -/Items/Kaede's scale|scale]] from her body; detailed with an intricate design, the scale exudes power but any specific ability it grants is as of yet undetermined.
