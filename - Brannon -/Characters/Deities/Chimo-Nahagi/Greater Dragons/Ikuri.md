Ikuri protects Chimo-Nahagi's southern coast and great reef - having spent so much time there, it has adapted to blend in with it's environment - unlike the other Great Dragons, Ikuri is a known socialite and spends a lot of time cruising the southern coastlines. Despite it's warm and welcoming demeanour, Ikuri is known to have the wrath of a thousand storms: sinking many an invasion force that dare cross through its coral domain.
