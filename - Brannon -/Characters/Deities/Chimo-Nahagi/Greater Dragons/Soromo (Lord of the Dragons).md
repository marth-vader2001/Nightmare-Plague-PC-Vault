Master of all the dragons, Soromo is considered a lord amongst dragons - her epic size and power is unrivalled by all other beasts. Known for her ability to blot out the sun, Soromo is often seen flying fast across the country: unknown are her destinations or intention for she never seems to be seen leaving or arriving any one single location.
