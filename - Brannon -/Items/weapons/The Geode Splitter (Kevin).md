A gift born of the union between [[Sansom, the mountain shatterer]] and [[- Quinn -/Characters/Djinn/Auroris, the Shimmering Sentinel]]. This mighty weapon has the ability to split the ground in front of you and send out crystalline shockwaves: by striking the ground with the blade, you can will an effect into existence.

The blade is fuelled by the wielder's essence and can only be wielded effectively by descendants of [[Sansom, the mountain shatterer]] and [[- Quinn -/Characters/Djinn/Auroris, the Shimmering Sentinel]].
