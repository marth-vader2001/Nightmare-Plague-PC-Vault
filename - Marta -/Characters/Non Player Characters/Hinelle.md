### The Divine Diplomat

Born into a noble family, Hinelle was brought up within the [[Yilani Cemaati]]: born to [[Pontiff Eoma]] and [[Chancellor Sturgis]]. 

After spending many years training in clericism, she was bestowed the title of [[GÃ¼nes Kutsanmis]] - a unique title that anyone from Sunmaek would recognise. Before the start of the campaign,  a meeting is called for between Brokvar and Sunmaek (Two nations with an entwined history). Your father [[Chancellor Sturgis]] was enlisted on to the meeting council as a representative of the state and the church and as both his daughter and the "gench-kisi", you are expected to come to Brokvar with him.
