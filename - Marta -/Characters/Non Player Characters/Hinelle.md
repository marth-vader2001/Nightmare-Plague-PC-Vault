### The Divine Diplomat

Born into a noble family, Hinelle was brought up within the and was able to spend a lot of time with the religion's leaders: [[Pontiff Sully]] and [[Pontiff Eoma]]

After spending many years training as a cleric, you were bestowed the title of "gench-kisi" - a unique title that anyone from Sunmaek would recognise. Before the start of the campaign,  a meeting is called for between Brokvar and Sunmaek (Two nations with an entwined history). Your father [[Chancellor Sturgis]] was enlisted on to the meeting council as a representative of the state and the church and as both his daughter and the "gench-kisi", you are expected to come to Brokvar with him.
