### The Divine Diplomat

Born into a noble family, you were brought up under the gaze of the twin sun. Literally, because from Sunmaek you can see two suns in the sky and figuratively because you grew up within the "church of the sun" (name tbc) and were cared for deeply by its two leaders **the sun's twin pontiffs**.

After spending many years training as a cleric, you were bestowed the title of "gench-kisi" - a unique title that anyone from Sunmaek would recognise. Before the start of the campaign,  a meeting is called for between Brokvar and Sunmaek (Two nations with an entwined history). Your father [[Chancellor Sturgis]] was enlisted on to the meeting council as a representative of the state and the church and as both his daughter and the "gench-kisi", you are expected to come to Brokvar with him.
